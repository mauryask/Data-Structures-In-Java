===> Time Complexity (worst Case)

1: Acess time : O(1)
2: Insertion : O(n)
3: Deletion : O(n)
4: Search : O(n)

==> Jagged Arrays or Ragged arrays both are same

==> In Java 2D arrays elements are stored neither in "row major" nor in "Column major order"
They are stored as the array of arrays.

===> languages and order
--> C/C++/Objective-C/Pascal --> Row major order
--> Fortron/Matlab/Julia --> Column major order
--> Java/C#/Swift --> Neither row major nor in column major order
